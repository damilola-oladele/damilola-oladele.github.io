I have only two weeks left to complete my three-month [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) internship with [Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/). As I look back on the past few months, all I can think about is how fast time flies. This is especially true when you have so much to do in a short time.

[Last week](/posts/outreachy-week-ten), I shared with you an overview of the [Wagtail user guide documentation](https://guide.wagtail.org/) project. I also shared with you the various skills I learned while working on the project. Likewise, I discussed my progress in learning the various technologies used in building Wagtail CMS.

In this week's article, I share the challenges I encountered while learning these technologies, particularly the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework.

## Week eleven in review

This week, I have been learning the basics of Django and what to expect from the framework. While understanding the fundamentals of [Python](https://www.python.org/) was quite easy for me, understanding the basics of Django is taking more time than I expected.

I started my learning of Django by going through the quickstart tutorial in the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/). Although I was able to complete the task, I had trouble understanding what I was doing. I discussed this challenge with one of my mentors, [Thibaud](https://github.com/thibaudcolas) and he suggested that I try a different tutorial. He proceeded to share with me another quickstart tutorial, put together by the [Django girls](https://djangogirls.org/). Though the [Django girls' quickstart tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/) is longer and took more of my time, it helped me understand the basics of Django and some of its features.

## The week ahead

Part of my tasks for the week is to complete the fourth programming task given to me by my mentors. Unfortunately, the challenges I experienced while going through the two quickstart tutorials prevented me from completing this programming task.

My mentor, [Storm](https://github.com/stormheg), has given me a new challenge. The challenge is to build a web library application with Django, which displays a list of books. Each of these books should have an author, a title, and an **ISBN (International Standard Book Number)**. Also, clicking on the book should take the user to a page that displays the details and a short overview of the book. Additionally, users of the website should be able to search for any book by its author, title, or ISBN.

My plan for the coming week is to continue learning Django by starting work on the library application challenge and completing the fourth programming task.
