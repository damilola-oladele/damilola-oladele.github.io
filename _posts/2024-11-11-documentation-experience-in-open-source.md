How often do you hear that contributing to open-source projects is one of the best ways to build documentation experience? Personally, I've lost count. After speaking with many aspiring technical writers, I've found that it's easier said than done.

Before we dive in, let’s clarify something. When I refer to open-source documentation contributions, I’m not referring to minor edits, like fixing typos or correcting grammar. While these contributions are valuable, they’re often hard to showcase to potential employers as proof of documentation skills.

With that in mind, here are some challenges you might face:

## Some open-source projects aren’t as open as you think

The first reality check might be surprising. While many projects have welcoming communities, others maintain a structure that limits contributions from newcomers. It often comes down to the human factor in open-source projects. Remember, these projects are usually a product of people’s hard work and dedication. So some maintainers view their projects more as personal ventures than as community initiatives.

While you will meet maintainers who welcome you with enthusiasm and support, others might not be as accepting. If this happens, don’t take it personal. It’s simply the nature of some projects. The best approach is to thank them for their time and move on to projects with more open communities.

## The irony of missing documentation

Ironically, the lack of documentation itself can be one of the biggest barriers to contributing. Some open-source projects, even popular ones, lack clear guidelines for new contributors. Too often, I’ve found myself excited to contribute, only to discover little or no information on how to get started.

The reality is that while most people agree that documentation is essential for the success of open-source projects, it often takes the back seat due to limited resources, time constraints, and competing priorities.

## Limited human resources for review and feedback

Writing quality documentation isn’t a solo effort. It requires collaboration with engineers and other stakeholders. And since no one person knows every detail of a project, finding someone to review your work can be challenging. This delay can be frustrating, especially if you’re eager to learn and contribute but end up waiting for feedback.

## Lack of experience with project technologies

Writing effective documentation for open-source projects requires a deep technical understanding. So if you don't have the right experience, you'll need to dedicate a lot of time to learning about the project's core technologies.

It’s always helpful to find projects that align with your technical background. For instance, if you want to contribute to a web framework, some experience with the programming language it’s built on will make the process easier and more enjoyable.

## You haven’t built trust with the community yet

Lastly, meaningful documentation contributions require a significant time investment from maintainers, who need to provide insights, feedback, and technical guidance. Many maintainers are cautious about investing time in newcomers, as they’ve experienced contributors who disappear after initial interactions or make superficial changes that don’t align with the project’s goals.

While this can feel discouraging, remember that consistency and patience go a long way. By making regular minor contributions, you can build trust and establish yourself as a valuable member of the community over time.<br><br>

In conclusion, gaining documentation experience through open source takes time and careful planning. The challenges are real, but don't let them stop you from trying. Instead, use them to plan your approach better. Look for projects that match what you already know technically. Take time to understand the project and get to know its community. Also, remember that earning trust takes time, but the documentation experience you'll gain is worth the effort.
