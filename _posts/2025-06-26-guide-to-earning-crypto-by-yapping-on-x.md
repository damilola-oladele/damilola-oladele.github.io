In my previous article, [What is yapping in crypto?](/_posts/2025-06-21-what-is-yapping.md), I explained the term as a way to earn crypto by making public posts, replies, or interactions on platforms like [X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/activus_d). I also explained why the earning model was introduced in the crypto space.

In this post, I will walk you through how to yap on X using [Kaito](https://www.kaito.ai/), an AI-driven digital asset search engine focused on cryptocurrency and Web3.

Now, let's get started.

## Select a project to yap

Once your profile is ready, it’s time to find a project to yap about on X.

Click Kaito Earn from the left sidebar. You will see a list of available campaigns displayed as project cards. Each card shows key information such as the reward pool, number of participants, and campaign deadline.

Click Check on any of the cards to see:

Pick a project that aligns with your interests or audience, then yap about it on X.

## Start contributing and earning yaps

Once you’ve chosen a campaign, start posting directly on X. Make sure your posts are public and relevant to the project. The Kaito algorithm tracks your yaps using a mix of engagement signals and quality indicators.

The Kaito Yaps algorithm evaluates your contributions based on three key factors: volume (the number of posts you share), engagement (real, meaningful interactions with your posts), and semantics (how relevant and informative your content is).

Avoid keyword spamming or tagging Kaito in every post, as the AI algorithms are designed to detect and filter out low-quality or irrelevant content.

Also, focus on being authentic and don’t rely on hype alone. Instead, share insights, opinions, or reactions that add value to the conversation.

To track your performance, visit the Yapper Leaderboard. It highlights the top X accounts contributing to each project based on their share of voice and engagement.You can draw inspiration from how they post and what kind of engagement they’re getting.

Congratulations! You’re now a professional yapper, ready to earn crypto for your posts.
