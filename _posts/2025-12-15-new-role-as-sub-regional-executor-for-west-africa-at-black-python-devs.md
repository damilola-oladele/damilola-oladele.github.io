After 22 months as Documentation Lead for Black Python Devs, I’m stepping into a broader leadership role while continuing to lead documentation efforts.

I’m the new <a href="https://github.com/BlackPythonDevs/blackpythondevs/blob/main/byelaws/article_ii.md#section-6-sub-regional-executor" target="_blank">Sub-Regional Executor</a> for West Africa.

This role excites me because of the strong foundation laid by the previous leadership team, whose work and impact have been both impressive and motivating. [Abigail Afi Gbadago](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abigail-afi-gbadago/) served as Regional Executor for Africa, [Emmanuel Ugwu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuel-ugwu-b58b80223?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADg8gnQBXOXcwNFfixYlgGZScoEsO3XuQEU&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3Bfb2gUOOISLabgHQAPHStbg%3D%3D) served as Vice Executor for Africa, and [Lazouich Ford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lazouich-ford/) and [Keanya Phelps CAPM](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keanyaphelps/) served as Executors in the United States.

In this new role, I will coordinate with local Python communities and leaders across West Africa. The goal is to continue advancing Black Python Devs’ mission to provide guidance, mentorship, and career support for Black Pythonistas globally.

I will not be working alone, and I am excited to collaborate with other newly elected members of the leadership team. My priorities include identifying active Python communities across West Africa, building relationships with local leaders and organizers, understanding the specific challenges Python developers face in the region, and creating programs that address those needs. I will also work to connect West African Python developers with opportunities for speaking, mentoring, and contributing to open-source projects.

The work begins now. If you are a Python developer or community organizer in West Africa, I would love to hear from you. Let’s build something meaningful together.
