If you follow the latest trends in cryptocurrencies and Web3, you’ve likely come across the word “yapping.” The term appears in community discussions, leaderboard rankings, and conversations around earning models in blockchain and web3. This raises a question: what does yapping mean, and why does it matter now?

Yapping means making public posts, replies, or interactions on platforms like X (formerly Twitter). These actions promote and support, or comment on a Web3 project. Yapping goes beyond superficial metrics. It offers a structured form of community-led engagement that values quality over volume. In return, participants earn rewards through a earning model that is now known as yap-to-earn.

The term “yapping” draws from the concept of talk-to-earn, signaling a shift in how projects capture attention and drive participation. This model moves attention away from just influencers and paid campaigns. It puts the voice and the reward potential in the hands of everyday community members.

This article introduces the concept of yapping, explains the thinking behind it, and shows why the Yap-to-Earn model is emerging as a sustainable alternative to older crypto marketing and earning strategies.

## Why the yap-to-earn model

Crypto projects have always depended on attention. Earlier models relied on influencer marketing, sponsored posts, and centralized token distributions. Then came play-to-earn, where users collected rewards for in-game actions. These models aimed to grow fast, but most failed to last.

One key flaw was the rise of ghost followers and engagement inflation. Projects paid influencers or launched giveaways that attracted large audiences with no genuine interest. These users followed for incentives, not the mission. They rarely engaged, quickly vanished and left behind inflated numbers with little substance.

Another issue was short-term extraction over long-term community value. Models like yield farming encouraged users to chase rewards across protocols without building real loyalty. Once the rewards dried up, users moved on. The result was a pattern of brief attention spikes, followed by decline and silence.

The Yap-to-earn model addresses these defects by directly linking the value of conversation to tangible rewards. Instead of relying on passive consumption or repetitive actions, yap-to-earn platforms recognize and reward users for their active, thoughtful participation in crypto discussions. This model values the quality and impact of your contributions, not just your follower count or time spent online.

Projects like Kaito and Sanctum have pioneered this approach. On Kaito, users connect their X (formerly Twitter) accounts and earn “Yap Points” for posting high-quality, relevant content about crypto. The platform uses AI to evaluate the substance of each post, rewarding users who add real value to the conversation. Sanctum takes a similar approach, incentivizing users to share insights and analysis that help others navigate the crypto landscape.
